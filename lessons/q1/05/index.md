# Lesson 5 – Software Development
{:.no_toc}

All lectures will be delivered as readings that you complete on your own time. Post questions with the lesson [here](TODO).

There is no Methodology Assignment associated with this lesson. However, it builds on the software development principles introduced in [Lesson 3](../03), and your projects will be graded according to how closely they follow these principles.

**Reminders:** 
- The [Quarter 1 Project Checkpoint](../../../assignments/projects/q1) is **Sunday, October 30th!**
- Take a look at the new [Resources](../../../resources) tab of the course website.
