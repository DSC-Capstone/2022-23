Each week describes what students are being assigned in other portions
of the course, especially when it relates to the domains in some way.

## Week 0

* Students learn that domain's meet in discussion section once/week,
  that they must do the readings/tasks for the domain *ahead* of
  meeting, and come prepared to discuss the reading.
* Students must turn in a 'participation' assignment every week, 24hrs
  before section meets. Mentors don't need to create their own
  assignments. See [here](/assignments/quarter-1-participation).

## Week 1

* Students are required to access and understand the basics of the
  [DSMLP Cluster](https://dsc-capstone.github.io/resources/computing/). 
  The cluster has a shared volume with separate storage for each
  domain. They will be expected to use a combination of local and
  remote development in this course.
* Domain mentors who wish to use the cluster (and/or store data there)
  can use a course account (each domain has their own). Contact course
  staff for access.

## Week 2

* Students are required to create a project template for the Quarter 1
  project, according to guidance from lecture.
* Mentors are suggested to discuss the main problem statement for the
  domain and make it clear what their 'project replication' will
  consist of (either, a specific paper, or a clear topic/roadmap for
  creating their own survey paper).

## Week 3

* Students will learn 'the anatomy of a scientific paper' and will
  have to analyze a paper in their domain on the effectiveness of its
  communication. (Have an example paper that students can
  analyze/emulate).
* Students should be getting their hands dirty as this point, either
  writing code, working through material by hand, or both.
* Students will turn in **checkpoint 1** of their [replication
  assignment]() at the end of week 4 - this consists of writing an
  'introduction' for their Q1 replication project (problem statement,
  background, and description of either data or basic method). You may
  want to assign them the task of writing a rough draft that you can
  discuss in class.
  
## Week 4

* Students turn in **checkpoint 1** of their [replication
  assignment](https://dsc-capstone.github.io/assignments/quarter-1-replication/) at the end of the week.
* Students learn about containerizing compute environments with
  Docker. They will be asked to create a starter container for their
  domain.
  
## Week 5

* Students learn about project software development and how to write
  flexible/generic code for changing investigations
  (i.e. 'parameterizing hypotheses'). They are assigned to think about
  different parameters in their project that should be kept in
  configuration.
  
## Week 6

* Students will turn in [project
  replication](https://dsc-capstone.github.io/assignments/quarter-1-replication/)
  **checkpoint 2** at the end of the week.
* Students learn about how to write an informative Exploratory Data
  Analysis (EDA). They will be assigned to:
      - take their data analyses in their domain and use them in a
        useful, clear narrative.
      - create a reproducible report, with figures automatically
        updateable.

## Week 7

* In discussion, you may want to have students discuss potential
  projects (e.g. repeat breakout rooms of two, randomly populated).
* Student groups for project proposals will be formed at end of week.
* Students will learn how to run long-running jobs on the DSMLP
  cluster using Kubernetes.

## Week 8

* Students sumbit a rough draft of project proposal.
* Students learn the anatomy of an effective elevator pitch and turn
  in an outline for their project.


## Week 9

* Final project proposal due.

## Week 10

* Elevator Pitches given in discussion.
* Replication project due.
