Welcome to the DSC capstone program! 👋 I’m in my second year as a lecturer in Data Science at UCSD. Prior to moving to San Diego, I was a student at UC Berkeley, where I also taught Data Science. And before that, I grew up in Windsor, Ontario – make sure to tell me if you’re also Canadian! 🇨🇦 Outside of the classroom, you’ll find me learning how to cook, FaceTiming my dog 🐶 back home, watching basketball, or [somehow being randomly selected to win gift cards on morning talk shows](http://rampure.org/assets/me_dancing.gif).

At UCSD, I've taught DSC 10, 40A, 80, and 90, but I've never been involved in the capstone sequence, so I'm looking forward to learning alongside you all for the next 20 weeks. Here's to a great year! 😊
