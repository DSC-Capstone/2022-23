Hello! My name is Teresa and I was raised in Sacramento County. I graduated from UCLA in Fall 2020 with a B.S. in Applied Math and minor in Statistics; I am currently a second year Statistics Master's student at UCSD. I TA'd for DSC 180AB and DSC 10 last year, and I also have a few years of experience as a Data Science Intern at Intel & Microsoft--I am looking forward to sharing how to apply the skills from DSC 180 to your future careers! In my free time, I enjoy volunteering, exploring the beaches & hiking trails in SD, baking/cooking new recipes, and reading fiction novels.
