I’ve worked as a Software Engineer in the industry for a little over 2 years - I can help you understand the best software engineering practices, how to structure->write->test->ship your code, and general coding hygiene. I can also help you with data visualisation and machine learning. In my free time, I love flying my drone, hiking and video editing.
