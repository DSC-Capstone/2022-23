I am a Computer Science MS student in the Neural Computation and Reinforcement Leaning lab in the cognitive science department. I am interested in software engineering and distributed systems. I like to read about animal behavior and ecology, and think about ways to decipher structure in the natural world using ML tools. I'm excited about sharing my experiences and learning from others. In my free time, I like to go to the beach, bike, watch TV or bake.

**Expertise:** Human and animal exploratory behavior, reinforcement Learning

**Can help with:** Data collection, Python, Spark, NLP, AWS, computational modeling
