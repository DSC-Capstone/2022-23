Hi I'm Keng-Chi, a PhD student in the Political Science department studying online behavior on social media, computational social science, and more recently political internet memes. I'm originally from Taipei, Taiwan (so I'm a bit picky about tea and boba ðŸ§‹). I've been TA for DSC180 before and I genuinely enjoyed talking with students and guide them to build their own project. Outside of work, you'll find me moving things in Rimac or enjoying independent films.

**Expertise:** Anything social science related (misinformation, social media, ethics, spatial, finance, health)

**Can help with:** R, social data collection, data visualization, causal inference, NLP, time series, spatial data, Python

**Domains: A03, A09, A11, A12, A13**
