## Project Report Checkpoint

The project report checkpoint is an opportunity to get feedback from
your domain mentor. Please check with your mentor on what is required
of the checkpoint for the report.

Requirements for submission:
* The report should be in PDF format (and will likely include all
  sections prior to the results and conclusion).
* The figures in the reports should *not* be created from screenshots:
  - Tables should be imported from csv.
  - Plots should be saved programmatically and imported (or converted
    from a notebook/Rmarkdown).
* Include a copy of your project proposal for reference in the
  appendix of your report (at the end).
* In a comment on the Canvas submission, include the tasks for which
  each group member was responsible.

This assignment is due at the end of week 5 and is graded by your
domain mentor.

## Visual Presentation Checkpoint

The visual presentation checkpoint requires you to write the technical
scaffolding for your visual output.

If you are creating a blog or presenting material on a webpage, you
must:
1. Create a live webpage that contains a skeleton/outline of your
   project webpage. It should contain titles and headers, but does not
   need to contain content (i.e. you should put thought into how your
   webpage is organized).
1. Turn in the code repository URL for the webpage (this is *not* your
   project GitHub repository). It is recommended that you use
   GitHub-Pages as covered in lecture.
1. The `README.md` in the code repository should contain the URL to
   your webpage, which the grader can use to visit your webpage.

If you are creating other visual output (e.g. your own web-server or
mobile application), you must
1. Create the scaffolding for your output. Please see the Professor
   for the specific requirements.
1. Turn in the code repository URL for the output (this is *not* your
   project GitHub repository).n
1. The `README.md` in the code repository should provide instructions
   on how to deploy the code.

This is graded by the methodology instructor and is graded P/NP. To
pass this assignment, you must make reasonable effort at each of the
items listed above.

## Code Artifact Checkpoint

The code artifact checkpoint will be an initial code review of your
project code artifact approximately halfway through the quarter. 

This checkpoint will check the code:
1. is well documented and build instructions are found in a
   README.
2. is structured with best-practices laid out in quarter-1
   methodology.
3. contains a test target that tests the pipeline on test data.
4. runs in a Docker Image on DSMLP, via `python run.py test`.

This is graded by the methodology instructor.

## Presentation Checkpoint

Each group will turn in initial slides for their presentation and do a
dry-run with TAs.

This is graded by the methodology instructor.
