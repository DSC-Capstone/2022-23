## Project Report Checkpoint

The project report checkpoint is an oppurtunity to get feedback from
your domain mentor. Please check with your mentor on what is required
of the checkpoint for the report.

This is graded by your domain mentor.

## Visual Presentation Checkpoint

The visual presentation checkpoint requires you to write the technical
scaffolding for your visual output. 

1. If you are creating a blog or presenting material on a webpage, you
   must provide both (1) the url of the webpage and (2) the code
   repository for the webpage. It's recommended that you use
   github-pages as covered in lecture.
2. If you are creating other visual output, you will need to provide
   code to deploy the output and instructions for doing so (via the
   README.md in your code repository).

This is graded by the methodology instructor.

## Code Artifact Checkpoint

The code artifact checkpoint will be an initial code review of your
project code artifact approximately halfway through the quarter. 

This checkpoint will check the code:
1. is well documented and build instructions are found in a
   README.
2. is structured with best-practices laid out in quarter-1
   methodology.
3. contains a test target that tests the pipeline on test data.
4. runs in a Docker Image on DSMLP, via `python run.py test`.

This is graded by the methodology instructor.

## Presentation Checkpoint

Each group will turn in initial slides for their presentation, along
with an outline of the presentation.

This is graded by the methodology instructor.
