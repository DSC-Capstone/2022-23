## Introduction

This quarter, each domain works through central problem that
introduces you to the area. This problem usually takes the form of a
(loose) replication of a known result found in a research paper in the
area. By the end of the quarter, you will need to summarize the results of
your work in a well-organized report that follows the norms of
research papers in your domain.

Your work will go beyond mere paraprhasing of the (possible) paper
being replicated:
* Your domain may be taking a different or narrower view than the work
  being replicated. Your report will reflect the work *you* are doing,
  not the broader research that may be found in the work being
  studied.
* You will likely be using data that differs from that used in the
  work you are studying.
* Your conclusions may be different than the work you are
  studying. You should present the conclusions drawn from *your* data
  and address any discrepancies with the work being studied.
* The code supporting your work will conform to best practices in data
  science software development.
  
## What is being turned in?

Work on the report comprises of:
1. A pdf submission of the report (w/feedback given by domain mentor),
2. The code that generates the contents of the report (w/feedback
   given by head instructor/TAs).
  
## Objectives for the Q1 report

* Carefully explaining work in your area study ensures you understand
  the area you'll be working in *very well*, details and
  all. In particular you will understand how to draw a rigorous
  conclusion in your area.
* Emulating finished work in your domain of inquiry encourages you to
  carefully consider how to effectively communicate technical ideas in
  your area.
* Critically view existing methodologies and conclusions in a way that
  raise possible improvements to existing approaches (e.g. possible
  work in Q2).
* Certain sections of your report (e.g. the literature review) will
  serve as a foundation for your writing in quarter 2.
* You will get practice using tools for producing such reports.
* Develop a library of useful code and the foundations
  of a code pipeline for further work in the area.

## Checkpoints

You will work on the report in three parts (two checkpoints and a final):
1. Checkpoint #1: Introduction (Part-1)
2. Checkpoint #2: Introduction (Part-2) / Methods
3. Final: Results and Conclusions

Each successive checkpoint should be cumulative (containing the
previous checkpoints) with a marker signifying where the current work
begins.

You must make the suggested changes to your previous checkpoint before
submitting the following assignment. If a mentor sees suggestions on a
previous section being ignored, that may *continue to affect your
grade*.

### Checkpoint #1

TODO

Report:
* Introduction (problem statement)
* Background / Literature Review
* Description of Data Generation Process
  - In case of a 'methods' focused project, focus on the type of data
    for which the method is appropriate.
* Basic description of observed data (e.g. relevant schematics, etc)

Code:
* Data ingestion pipeline
* Documentation (including addressing privacy concerns; design considerations)

### Checkpoint #2

TODO

Report:
* Data Quality Assessment; 'relevant' EDA
  - justify cleaning
* Description/implememtation of methods

Code:
* Develop cleaning code.
* Develop code that generates analysis/figures for EDA.
* Code up the methods that generate results.

### Final Report

TODO

Report:
* Write results and conclusion

Code:
* Develop code for generating results
* Develop code that generates analysis/figures for results
