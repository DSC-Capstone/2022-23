## Introduction

*This assignment is worked on in pairs*.

This quarter, each domain works through a central problem that
introduces you to the area. Depending on the domain, you will produce
either:
1. a replication of a known result in a (published) paper, or
2. an investigative paper, with a hands-on, data driven inquiry
   into a relevant question in the area.

By the end of the quarter, you will summarize the results of
your work in a well-organized report that follows the norms of
research papers in your domain.

Your work will go beyond mere paraprhasing of the existing work that
you study:
* Your domain may be taking a broader or narrower view than the work
  of any one paper. Your report will reflect the work *you* are doing,
  not the broader research that may be found in the work being
  studied.
* You will likely be using data that differs from that used in the
  work you are studying.
* Your conclusions may be different than the work you are
  studying. You should present the conclusions drawn from *your*
  data/methods and address any discrepancies with the work being
  studied.
* The code supporting your work will conform to best practices in data
  science software development.
  
## What is being turned in?

Work on the report comprises of:
1. A pdf submission of the report (w/feedback given by domain mentor),
2. The code that generates the contents of the report (w/feedback
   given by head instructor/TAs).
  
## Objectives for the Q1 report

* Carefully explaining work in your area study ensures you understand
  the area you'll be working in *very well*, details and
  all. In particular you will understand how to draw a rigorous
  conclusion in your area.
* Emulating finished work in your domain of inquiry encourages you to
  carefully consider how to effectively communicate technical ideas in
  your area.
* Critically view existing methodologies and conclusions in a way that
  raise possible improvements to existing approaches (e.g. possible
  work in Q2).
* Certain sections of your report (e.g. the literature review) will
  serve as a foundation for your writing in quarter 2.
* You will get practice using tools for producing such reports.
* Develop a library of useful code and the foundations
  of a code pipeline for further work in the area.

## Checkpoint

You will work on the report in two parts (one checkpoints and a final):
2. Checkpoint #1: Introduction / Methods
3. Final: Results and Conclusions
