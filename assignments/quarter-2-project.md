The Capstone Project is the main task of the course. The work is done
in the groups formed in Quarter 1. There are four components to
project, listed below.

As projects vary, you may choose the primary output of your project to
either be (1) a scientific report or (2) a visual presentation or
functional product. While every group must produce both of these for
their project, you may choose which is has more weight when graded.

### Report

The report for your project introduces/contextualizes the problem,
describes the methods used, states the results, and draws conclusions
about the results. This summary of your work follows best practices in
scientific writing, as laid out in quarter 1.

The report is graded by the domain mentor.

### Visual Presentation

The visual presentation may be a website, blog, artwork, functional
product, or service. There must be some consumer-facing (or
general-audience) component to this work. If your visual presentation
is not a blog, it should be approved by your domain mentor.

The visual presentation is graded by the methodology instructor.

### Code Artifact

The code artifact contains all code for building/reproducing the
project, following best-practices in Data Science software
development. It is maintained in a *public* GitHub repository.

The code artifact is graded by the methodology instructor.

### Presentation

The presentation is a 15-20 minute slide-based presentation of the
project. This presentation must balance accessibility to a general
audience alongside detailed material for the domain expert.

The presentation is graded by both the domain mentors and the
methodology instructor.

### Checkpoints

Each of the above components will have one checkpoint. See the
checkpoints assignment for details.
