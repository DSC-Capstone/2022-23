## Overview

Welcome to the capstone program! The capstone program is a **two-quarter sequence** (Fall 2022 and Winter 2023) in which you will be mentored by a faculty or industry expert in their domain of expertise. By the end of Quarter 2, you will design and execute a project in that domain in teams of 2-4. You can see the projects from last year [here](https://dsc-capstone.github.io/projects-2021-2022/).

At a high level, here's how the capstone program is organized:
- In Quarter 1 (DSC 180A), you gain background information in your mentor's domain, by means of replicating a known result. By the end of Quarter 1, you will have completed a replication project (known as the "Quarter 1 Project") and will have a proposal for a more independent project (known as the "Quarter 2 Project", or the capstone project).
- In Quarter 2 (DSC 180B), you execute the Quarter 2 Project you proposed at the end of Quarter 1.

Throughout both quarters, there is a "methodology" component that will supplement your knowledge of your domain with best practices in software engineering and project management.

Below is the syllabus for Quarter 1; the syllabus for Quarter 2 will arrive a bit closer to the start of Winter 2023.

# Quarter 1 (DSC 180A, Fall 2022)

## Description

TODO: ignore this for now

There are two "components" to Quarter 1:
- Discussion section (**required**), where

As mentioned above, the primary goal of Quarter 1 is to get you acquainted with your mentor's domain. The main deliverable in Quarter 1 is the "Quarter 1 Project". Alongside your domain-specific instruction, which will happen in "discussion", you will receive methodology-specific instruction through "lectures" (which you will apply when working on your Quarter 1 Project, and ultimately, your Quarter 2 Project).

Your Quarter 1 Project, which you will complete individually, will serve as a foundation for your Quarter 2 Project Proposal, which you will also submit at the end of Quarter 1. The Quarter 2 Project will be completed in groups of 2-4.


Data Scientists typically work on projects in groups. As such, large
assignments throughout the sequence (the replication; project
proposal; project itself) are worked on in groups. Like in a career or
research situation, these groups will be formed using a variety of
factors, including academic background, mutual interests, and a little
randomness.

## Getting Started

Before the quarter begins:

- Confirm the date and time of your section in the [Domains and Mentors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WSSB0kXRisLVnvrckY0VpJ8mPBt4yNXCyNfEAJ7x2J8/edit#gid=637456872) spreadsheet, as it may have updated since you last checked. 
    - **Note that sections begin the week of September 26th.**
    - Some sections have merged, including B02/B05 and B03/B19.
    - If your section is held in SDSC, follow the instructions found [here](../office-hours) to enter.
- Make sure you can access:
    -  [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/442598), where all assignments will be submitted.
    - [EdStem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/28947/discussion/), the discussion forum we will use for methodology. **All class-wide announcements will be sent here!**

Note that we will not be using Canvas at all this quarter.

## Course Components

### Lecture (Methodology)

Lectures are focused on methodological skills that can apply to all domains. In lectures, we will cover best practices with software engineering for data science and project management (see the [course homepage](../) for a full listing in Quarter 1). Based on feedback from prior iterations of the capstone, we've decided to deliver methodology lectures as **lecture notes** that you read on your own time and come to synchronous sessions for help with. Specifically:
- Each Sunday, we will post a "lesson" on the [course homepage](../). A lesson will contain all of the methodology content you need to learn for the week. (We will make an announcement on EdStem when we release new lessons).
- The day after, on Monday, you have the option to attend synchronous "Lecture Help" sessions during the scheduled lecture slots. These are scheduled on Mondays from 3-3:50PM and 4-4:50PM, both in Mandeville Center B-210 ([map](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1005#!m/232275)). In these sessions, we will answer any questions you have with the lesson.
    - You can attend either (or both) session, regardless of which lecture section you're enrolled in.
    - Note that **in Week 1 (on September 26th), we will hold a "traditional" introductory lecture during the scheduled lecture slots, and you should plan to attend**. The plan mentioned above begins with Week 2.
- Many methodology lectures will have an accompanying "methodology assignment", due the following weekend. See the [Assignments](#assignments) section for more details.
    - In the Lecture Help sessions, we will provide help on methodology assignments as well â€“ **expect the assignments to be much easier to complete if you come to Lecture Help sessions**!

### Discussion (Domain)

Each week, you will meet with your domain mentor for an hour in discussion section. **Unlike Lecture Help sessions, attendance in discussion section is mandatory, and you must notify your mentor in advance if you can't make it.**

Each week, your domain mentor will assign you a combination of readings and tasks to complete, along with "participation" questions to answer to ensure that you've engaged with the material. You must complete these participation questions **24 hours before discussion**, as your responses to them will drive the class discussion. Your mentor may provide you with specific participation questions to answer; if not, you should answer [these](../assignments/participation/q1) "default" participation questions. You should complete the other tasks they assign you before discussion as well, though you may not have to submit them anywhere.

Note that discussion section will consist of **discussion**, not lecture. As such, **if
you do not ask questions in discussion section, no discussion will
occur.** To get the most out of the capstone program, you should actively participate in discussion section.


### Office Hours

There are two flavors of office hours:
- **Methodology office hours**, held by the methodology (DSC 180A) course staff. Come to these office hours with questions on methodology lectures and assignments, and on how to apply methodology concepts to your domain work. See the [Office Hours](../office-hours) page on the course website for the schedule.
    - Note that different TAs have expertise in different areas; see the [Staff](../staff) page for a listing on each TA's area of expertise.
- **Domain office hours**, held by your domain mentor. Come to these office hours with questions on the readings or tasks your mentor assigned you or on your projects. See the [Domains and Mentors](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WSSB0kXRisLVnvrckY0VpJ8mPBt4yNXCyNfEAJ7x2J8/edit#gid=637456872) sheet or your section's website (if applicable) for the schedule.
    - You should attend your mentor's office hours at least three times throughout the quarter.

### Remark on How the Course is Split

As is common in data science, you will likely find yourself as a
bridge between domain specialists and (computing) methodology
specialists. In this course, it is totally normal if your domain mentors do not know specifics of your code
(or even know the language you are coding in!). You will have access to help from both methodology experts (in office hours and EdStem) and your domain mentor (in discussion section and office hours). As such, it is up to you to formulate your questions for the appropriate audience (methodology expert or domain expert) so that you can adequately communicate with them to solve the problems you are facing.

## Assignments and Grades

TODO: put a good description here

|Component|Description|Due|Weight|Grading Notes|
|---|---|---|
|[Methodology assignments](../) | Assignments that develop your software development and project management skills. Submitted individually. | Bi-weekly | 5% | 1% each |
|Participation questions ([default questions](../assignments/participation/q1))| Weekly questions to keep you engaged with the material and to inform your mentor of class progress. Submitted individually. | Weekly, 24 hours before discussion | 5%| Graded for completeness by methodology TAs |
|Overall participation | Engaging in conversation in discussion section is important for success in the capstone; as such, your mentor will assign you an overall participation grade at the end of the quarter. | N/A | 5%| Graded by mentors  |
| [Quarter 1 Project](../assignments/projects/q1) | A chance to put together everything you've produced while learning about your domain. Submitted individually. | Week 5 (checkpoint), Week 10 (final submission) | 70% | 50%: reports, graded by mentors (checkpoint + final) <br> 20%: code, graded by methodology TAs (checkpoint + final; graded to ensure best practices are followed) |
| [Quarter 2 Project Proposal](../assignments/projects/q2-proposal) | Proposal for final capstone project. Submitted in groups. | Week 9 | 15% | Graded by both methodology TAs (elevator pitch) and domain mentors (schedule + write-up) |

### General Rubric

In order to ensure consistent grading across such a diverse array of domains, we will utilize a **coarse grading scheme with a clear rubric**. This scheme will reflect broad checkpoints that you meet, and should help maintain
focus on *large, impactful* things that you can improve on while reducing grading disagreements.
  
The grading scheme we will use for **all assignments** (other than for participation questions) follows an A/B/C/F scale (without plus/minus), developed by Shannon Ellis:

|Grade|Criteria|
|---|---|
| A (4.0) |Accomplishes the task accurately, completely, and clearly. Code is clear, effective, and efficient. Written component is concise, at the appropriate level, and correct. Oral component (when applicable) is effective and within the time limit. |
| B (3.0) |Accomplishes the task well, but lacks some completeness or clarity. Code runs but lacks some aspect of clarity, effectiveness, and or efficiency. Written component is logical and generally correct, but lacks either clarity or accuracy. Oral component (when applicable) is moderately effective and/or slightly outside the time window. |
| C (2.0) |The task is somewhat accomplished, but lacks significantly when it comes to completeness and clarity. Code present but does not accomplish the task up to the standards of a data science graduating senior. Written component lacks substantial clarity/correctness. Oral component (when applicable) significantly lacks effectiveness/clarity. |
| F (0.0) |The task largely remains unaccomplished. Code lacks completeness, structure, and is unclear. Written component lacks required information to understand the work done. Oral component (when applicable) is nonsensical/unclear. |

### Letter Grades

Individual assignments will be graded on the A/B/C/F scale above, and your overall course grade will be determined by using the proportions listed at the start of this section. Letter grades will be assigned using the standard university cutoffs. Note that:
- Your course letter grade can include +/-, even if none of your individual assignment grades do.
- At the end of Fall 2022 you will receive a grade in DSC 180A, and at the end of Winter 2023 you will receive a grade in DSC 180B; each course is worth 4 units.

With all of that said, in this course, you should not worry about your letter grade. The grades you receive on individual components of the course are meant to provide you with feedback on how to improve future submissions. **To be successful in this course, you should strive to have engaging interactions with your domain mentor and to produce work that you are proud of.** Nobody will remember whether you got an A- or a B in the capstone, but they will remember if you produce a stellar final project.

## Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity

In DSC 180, we expect you to work hard and engage with material that
originates outside the academic walls. All ideas and work must be your
own, that of your approved group, or properly cited. Act with
integrity and **don't cheat**.

In DSC 180 you are encouraged to use outside resources to help with
your work. However, **you must properly cite any concepts, writing, or
code** that originates from other sources. If you are unsure of
whether something needs a citation, it's best to:
* consult the domain expert for your section,
* follow the examples in course readings, and
* place code citations with the relevant link in comments.

The following activities are considered cheating and **ARE NOT ALLOWED**
in DSC 180 (this is not an exhaustive list):

* Using or submitting either writing or code acquired from other
  students (except your group, where allowed).
* Not properly citing ideas, writing, or code acquired from outside
  sources. (Citations are a good thing!)
* Having any other student complete any part of an assignment on your
  behalf.
* Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else.

The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and
**ARE ALLOWED** in DSC 180:

* Discussing the general approach to understanding or solving a problem.
* Talking about debugging/cleaning strategies or issues you ran into and how you solved them.
* Using outside material with proper citations (including
StackOverflow code!).
