# ðŸ“† Office Hours

**Note:** This page only contains the office hours schedule for **methodology** office hours.
- To see the areas of expertise for each TA, check the **[ðŸ™‹Staff](../staff)** page.
- Ask your domain mentor for their office hours (or check the Domains and Mentors sheet linked at the top right); they will not appear in this calendar.

Unless otherwise specified, all methodology office hours are held both in-person and via Zoom.
- To attend in-person (recommended), come to the second floor of the east wing of the San Diego Supercomputer Center
([map](https://g.page/SDSC_UCSanDiego?share)). Enter SDSC from the east
entrance on Hopkins Drive, take the elevator up to the second floor, turn left
at the kitchen, and meet in the common area. You may need a code to access
SDSC â€“ [see EdStem](https://edstem.org/us/courses/28947/discussion/1798016). 
- To join remotely, click the link below.

Note that the methodology "lecture help" sessions, held on Mondays from 3-3:50PM and 4-4:50PM, are held in Mandeville B-210 and are not held on Zoom.

**If you'd like to meet with someone and can't make it to their office hours, feel free to send them an email to schedule an appointment**; emails can be found on the [Staff](../staff) page.
