### How do I know what projects will look in a domain?

The domains listed at the bottom of the page vary in specificity;
different mentors may have different visions for how much flexibility
those in their domain have in determining their project.

When you choose an employer after graduation, the precise nature of
your work will be unknown, and may change depending on the
circumstances. Generally, your choice depend on your compatibility
with the *general* area in question. Take the same perspective here;
you won't know precisely the topuc, only the general area. If
you would like to know more about a specific area, look up the
mentor's research page or take a look at previous Capstone project ehy
have mentored (if any).

### What should I consider when deciding on a domain (subject-matter)?

When considering domains of study, you should consider:
 - Whether you prefer a class focused on methods, systems, or an
   applied domain
 - Whether any specialized knowledge will be highly leveraged in the
   domain. While all domains are open to all students who meet the
   prerequisites, the process of "getting-up to speed" in the domain
   during quarter-1 will require more work if you have no exposure
   to the specialized knowledge.
   
Beyond that, really *all* domains cover interesting questions that
offer a great opportunity for two quarters of research!

### What if I can't sign up for my prefered domain?

Being a Data Scientist requires getting up to speed in an area you may
not know and bringing your quantitative skillset. Really, any of
these areas are quite interesting, once you get into the problem!
Please be open-minded about your area of choice!

Furthermore, not everyone realized that the problems that may seem
mundane are often more interesting, more realistic to 'real-world'
problems a data scientist might tackle, and yield more interesting
results. A project on a trendy topic runs the risk of coming across
like a cursory data science blog, as oppossed to the mature project
this has the potential to be.

### What should I consider when choosing a domain (mentor)?

When considering potential domain mentors, be aware that they will
be acting in very different capacities than a course
instructor. Here are a few points to consider:
 - The biggest factor in a successful project is personalized
   attention and a small class. You should prefer to enroll in
   domains with smaller enrollment, even if the you think you might
   like a different mentor/subject more.
 - The skillset required for mentoring relies more on expertise in
   an area and less on the track-record of an course
   instructor.
 - You mentor may be a source of letters of recommendation in the
   future. As such, research faculty leading small sections give you
   the best opportunity for future opportunities!

**Domain B05**

* Mentor: Alexander Cloninger + Deloitte
* Topic: A critical element of a transportation demand model is the
  capability to estimate mode choice; the travel mode that each
  synthetic person uses to get from activity to activity. Correctly
  determining the distribution of modes in the model has implications
  for understanding the impact of any policy, land use, or
  infrastructure change over time. A common approach to mode choice
  estimation is through use of a complex framework rooted in utility
  theory. This setup typically involves a multitude of features and
  associated coefficients, many of which likely have a negligible impact
      of mode choice determination but make constructing the model
  challenging. We’ve been experimenting with a machine learning approach
  to mode choice modeling that involves identifying only essential
  features and building a simplified model that can be more easily
  generalized and deployed.

* Current research questions:
  - Can we use a machine learning approach, such as XGBoost or another
    tree-based method, to construct a simplified mode choice model by
    identifying features that are most important to determining mode
    choice?

  - How can we confirm that a revised model yields similar/appropriate
    results as compared to the previous method?

  - Can we generalize the approach to other populations?

* Data: Table containing trip and person characteristics, with labels
    for target trip travel mode. Approximately 14 million rows by 32
    columns. Data exist as integers, floats, categorical variables
    encoded as numeric, strings, and Boolean values. A data dictionary
    will be provided.

    Table containing calculated utility values for each travel mode
    for each trip. Approximately 14 million rows by 15 columns. Data
    are entirely numeric. Data dictionary and explanation of the
    calculations used to produce the utility values will be provided.

  issues as they are perceived by users and their devices, not just
  network speed (and other metrics) between the service provider’s
  network and the user’s modem.  This project will use (and possibly
  extend) a network emulation & data collection tool developed by an
  HDSI Capstone team last year to generate data and emulate network
  conditions.  This will enable service providers to work with their
  customers to ensure that their actual internet experience is as good
  as the network can deliver.
