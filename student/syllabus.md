## Course Description

Quarter 1 of the capstone covers two parallel topics:
1. The basics of “data science methodology” for a large project,
   including best practices for data handling and project
   reproducibility.
2. Beginning research into your choice of domain. Acquaintance with a
   domain is made via replicating a specified result on a curated
   dataset in the listed possible areas (e.g. genetics, cognitive science,
   computer vision, oceanography, political science, sociology,
   industry analytics, and art).
   

The replication of the domain result in (2) will use the best
practices learned in (1). This work then serves as a foundation for
project proposals due at the end of the quarter. The projects will be
worked on, in groups, in the second quarter. While the methodology
portion is taught in a traditional lecture setting, most of the
material covered in this course will be done through reading, data
exploration, and ensuing discussion.

## Course Components

### Lecture (data science methodology)
One hour per week will be devoted to lecture on data science
methodology. There will be accompanying light homework assignments.

### Discussion (domain)

Two hours per week will be devoted to discussion about domain specific
topics, as such you must attend the section for your choice of
domain. Discussion will involve discussion about reading and
assignments, so it is imperative that you complete the relevant
assignments before attending discussion section. Each section begins
with a set of questions to which you will write a response; your
response will serve to stimulate class discussion.

### Remark on how the course is split

As is common in Data Science, you will likely find yourself as a
bridge between domain specialists and (computing) methodology
specialists. In the case of this course, it is expected and normal
that discussion section leaders will not know specifics of your code
(or even know the language you are coding in!). You will have both (1)
office hours with a methodology expert and (2) office hours and
discussion with domain experts. As such, it is up to you to formulate
your questions for the appropriate audience (domain expert or
computing expert), so that you can adequately communicate with them to
solve the problem you are facing.

## Course Deliverables

###  Methodology HW
Weekly HW on the lecture component of the course is meant to reinforce
lecture topics enough to enable you to apply the topics to the
domain-specific project. **This HW is worked on individually**.

### Replication of a result in chosen domain
These assignments serve the dual purpose of introducing you to your
domain of choice, as well as helping you learn the mechanics of
putting together a project in your specific domain. Your output will
serve “starter code” for your own project work in Q2. This output
generally falls into the following categories:

* Literature review (written report)
* Exploratory data analysis of dataset (written report)
* Result replication (written report)
* Data acquisition + cleaning (code)
* Full project pipeline (code)

**This HW is worked on individually**

### Project proposal

The final course deliverable is a project proposal for the second
quarter project. **This proposal (along with the project itself) will be
worked on in small groups.**

* Written proposal (with background research)
* Skeleton project workflow / github repository / page.
* Elevator pitch (video on Piazza)

**This proposal (along with the project itself) will be
worked on in small groups.**

## Assessments and Grades

The course grade will be computed using the following proportions:

|Component|% of Grade|
|---|---|
|Methodology HW|10%|
|Discussion Section Participation|10%|
|Domain result replication (3 reports)|30%|
|Domain result replication (workflow)|20%|
|Project proposal|30%|

## Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity

In DSC 180, we expect you to work hard and engage with material that
originates outside the academic walls. All ideas and work must be your
own, that of your approved group, or properly cited. Act with
integrity and don't cheat.

In DSC 180 you are encouraged to use outside resources to help with
your work. However, **you must properly cite any concepts, writing, or
code** that originates from other sources. If you are unsure of
whether something needs a citation, it's best to:
* consult the domain expert for your section, and
* follow the examples in course readings.
* place code citations with the relevant link in comments.

The following activities are considered cheating and ARE NOT ALLOWED
in DSC 180 (this is not an exhaustive list):

* Using or submitting either writing or code acquired from other
  students (except your partner, where allowed).
* Not properly citing ideas, writing, or code acquired from outside
  sources. (Citations are a good thing!)
* Having any other student complete any part of an assignment on your
  behalf.
* Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else.

The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and
ARE ALLOWED in DSC 180:

* Discussing the general approach to understanding or solving a problem.
* Talking about debugging/cleaning strategies or issues you ran into and how you solved them.
* Using outside material with proper citations (including
StackOverflow code!).
