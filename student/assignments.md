## Result Replication

*This assignment is worked on in groups of 2*.

The 'result replication' is the main output of the first quarter
work. The final result consists of a report and code replicating a
known result in your domain (chosen by your domain mentor). Doing a
careful job on this assignment will:
* Give you a broad overview of your domain, alongside a nuanced
  understanding of a small area within your domain. This will
  familiarize you with the way the field approaches questions and the
  data that's used to approach them.
* Serve as an initial codebase for your own Quarter 2 project.
* Serve as practice for writing your Quarter 2 (and as a rough draft of
  your background/literature review).
  
Quality work on the result replication *will* drastically reduce the
work you do on the Quarter 2 project -- building off of a thorough
result replication will allow your own project to more developed,
nuanced, and sophisticated!

The result replication project is broken into three parts:
* [Checkpoint 1](/assignments/quarter-1-replication-final)
* [Checkpoint 2](/assignments/quarter-1-replication-final)
* [Final Replication](/assignments/quarter-1-replication-final)

## Project Proposal

*This assignment is worked on in your project group of 2-4*.

The [project proposal](/assignments/quarter-1-project-proposal):
* details the problem you will investigate in Quarter 2, 
* lays out the initial plan for investigation, 
* gives a verbal 'elevator pitch' describing the relevance of the
  proposal.
  
The proposal will motivated with due diligence and data-driven
conclusions, much like a business or grant proposal.

## Methodology Assignments

The [methodology assignments](/assignments/quarter-1-methodology)
are weekly assignments that guide you through Data Science project
basics that will be useful as you work in your chosen
domain. Generally, these assignments have you apply a new tool or
concept to your specific domain problem. These assignments roughly
parallel lecture topics and fall into the following categories:
* Software Development for Data Science Projects
* Best Practices for Compute Environments
* Effective Scientific Communication
