## Result Replication (Quarter 1)

*This assignment is worked on in groups of 2*.

The 'result replication' is the main output of the first quarter
work. The final result consists of a report and code replicating a
known result in your domain (chosen by your domain mentor). Doing a
careful job on this assignment will:
* Give you a broad overview of your domain, alongside a nuanced
  understanding of a small area within your domain. This will
  familiarize you with the way the field approaches questions and the
  data that's used to approach them.
* Serve as an initial codebase for your own Quarter 2 project.
* Serve as practice for writing your Quarter 2 (and as a rough draft of
  your background/literature review).
  
Quality work on the result replication *will* drastically reduce the
work you do on the Quarter 2 project -- building off of a thorough
result replication will allow your own project to more developed,
nuanced, and sophisticated!

The [result replication project](/assignments/quarter-1-replication/)
is broken into three parts:
* [Checkpoint 1](/assignments/quarter-1-replication/#checkpoint-1)
* [Checkpoint 2](/assignments/quarter-1-replication/#checkpoint-2)
* [Final Replication](/assignments/quarter-1-replication#final-report)

## Project Proposal (Quarter 1)

*This assignment is worked on in your project group of 2-4*.

The [project proposal](/assignments/quarter-1-project-proposal):
* details the problem you will investigate in Quarter 2, 
* lays out the initial plan for investigation, 
* gives a verbal 'elevator pitch' describing the relevance of the
  proposal.
  
The proposal will motivated with due diligence and data-driven
conclusions, much like a business or grant proposal.

## Methodology Assignments (Quarter 1)

The [methodology assignments](/assignments/quarter-1-methodology)
are weekly assignments that guide you through Data Science project
basics that will be useful as you work in your chosen
domain. Generally, these assignments have you apply a new tool or
concept to your specific domain problem. These assignments roughly
parallel lecture topics and fall into the following categories:
* Software Development for Data Science Projects
* Best Practices for Compute Environments
* Effective Scientific Communication

## Participation (Quarter 1)

Each week, at least 24 hours prior to meeting with your domain, [submit
material for discussion](/assignments/quarter-1-participation) on
Canvas. This submission serves the following purposes:
* It serves as a regular self-evaluation tool and place to gather your
  thoughts, so that you can address difficulties in a timely
  manner. The precision reqired of doing this in writing holds your
  critical assessment of your understanding to a higher bar.
* It allows your domain mentor to structure discussion *ahead* of
  time, if they so choose.

**Note**: As every domain is different, your mentor may choose to have
you answer different questions than the one below. This assignment is
merely a *default* assignment. However, you should always be turning
something in.

## Capstone Project (Quarter 2)

The Capstone Project is the main task of the course. The work is done
in the groups formed in Quarter 1. There are four components to
project, listed below.

As projects vary, you may choose the primary output of your project to
either be (1) a scientific report or (2) a visual presentation or
functional product. While every group must produce both of these for
their project, you may choose which is has more weight when graded.

### Report

The report for your project introduces/contextualizes the problem,
describes the methods used, states the results, and draws conclusions
about the results. This summary of your work follows best practices in
scientific writing, as laid out in quarter 1.

The report is graded by the domain mentor.

### Visual Presentation

The visual presentation may be a website, blog, artwork, functional
product, or service. There must be some consumer-facing (or
general-audience) component to this work.

The visual presentation is graded by the methodology instructor.

### Code Artifact

The code artifact contains all code for building/reproducing the
project, following best-practices in Data Science software
development.

The code artifact is graded by the methodology instructor.

### Presentation

The presentation is a 15-20 minute slide-based presentation of the
project. This presentation must balance accessibility to a general
audience alongside detailed material for the domain expert.

The presentation is graded by both the domain mentors and the
methodology instructor.

### Checkpoints

Each of the above components will have one checkpoint.

## Participation (Quarter 2)

The participation in quarter 2 will consist of the 'weekly check-in':
a report listing what each team member accomplished in the previous
week, any obstacles they encountered, and any updates to the project
schedule for the upcoming week.
