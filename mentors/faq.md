### How much course preparation is required for hosting a domain?

Not as much as it may seem; the sequence is designed to reduce the overhead required to scale mentorship across multiple groups. The following list the main class-prep tasks:

- Q1: Weekly plan (readings + tasks).
- Q1: Questions for topics each week.

See example weekly plans from [previous quarters](https://github.com/afraenkel/DSC180A-DS-Methodology#contents) (there are 5 domains lists; visit each page to see the plan for that domain).

Quarter 2 requires no course preparation, only student/group meetings with feedback.

### What do students turn in throughout the sequence?

Students work on many assignments to both keep them on-track as well as to structure regular instructor feedback for student work. These assignments are largely pre-made and consistent across domains (with content specific to each domain).

- Weekly participation questions (found [here](../../students/assignments/participation)).
- Project checkpoints (for replication and project).
- Finished products (e.g. reports, code pipelines, presentation).

You can see everything that students are expected to turn in at the [🧑‍🎓 Students](../../students) page.

### How much time can I expect to spend grading?

The sequence is structured to minimize grading, while still giving thorough, actionable feedback.

- Weekly assignments are meant to be delivered in person (e.g. a verbal update); this is where you give feedback. The corresponding written assignments are turned in only for completion.
- Grades are given with a coarse precision (letter grade A/B/C/F with no plus/minus), with feedback in writing or given in office hours. This both helps maintain consistent grades across wildly different domains, as well as eases the grading. The letter grade assignment is typically &quot;obvious&quot;. However, it is very important that students receive actionable feedback from their assignments, as that is the very point of the checkpoint.
- Grading does not (need to) involve code. You should be able to generally assess the correctness of the code from the figures in the report. The methodological standards of the code are graded by the lecture staff. (You can grade code, however, if you so desire).
